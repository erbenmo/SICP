for small number, it improves too little every cycle
is 0.001 good tolerance for small number?
   sqrt(0.000025) = (0.03) looking for 0.005
0.001 too demanding for large number

good-engouth guess x
	     if global-previous - guess < 0.0001 * x
	     	good enough
	     else
		keep working ~
makes small number sqrt more precise (0.001 is not good enough)
